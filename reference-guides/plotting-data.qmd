Describes how to plotting NSIDC Datasets using standard tools like `cartopy`, `GeoViews`.

- Cover tricky plotting problems \- e.g. ice motion vectors  
- Defining EASE and NSIDC Polar projections in cartopy  
    - Examples of common grids (e.g., EASE2 25 km, PS 25 km), and hints for other grids (e.g., different resolutions).  _A set of specific examples might not be necessary if coordinates are included_
